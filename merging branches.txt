1.   # we merge branches, not specific commits.
    # we always merge to the current HEAD branches

    # switch to master branch
    git switch master

    # bugfix gets merged to master branch
    git merge bugfix

    # always switch to the destination branch, and then merge the auxiliary branch to the destination branch
    # during the merge only the content gets merged from one file to another, the branches still remain the same and separated.

    # merge conflicts: when same files's same line has updated in two different branches i.e master and bugfix branches in our case, in that case we come across merge conflict problem.
    # you need to manually fix the problem and then merge it.

    # Resolving the conflicts:
    # a. open up the files with merge conflicts.
    # b. edit the files to remove the conflicts. Decide which branch's content you want to keep in each conflict or keep the content from both.
    # c. remove the conflict markers in the document.
    # d. add your changes and then make a commit.
